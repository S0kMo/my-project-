# "Turtle Maze - Python Maze Game using Turtle Graphics"
- Introduction:
Welcome to the Turtle Maze project! This program utilizes the Python turtle module to create an interactive maze game. Players navigate through a maze using keyboard inputs while a turtle character moves around the screen. The goal is to guide the turtle to reach the maze's exit, encountering obstacles and challenges along the way. This project is a fun and educational way to explore turtle graphics, problem-solving, and algorithmic thinking.
