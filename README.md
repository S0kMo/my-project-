# "Turtle Maze - Python Maze Game using Turtle Graphics"
- Introduction:
Welcome to the Turtle Maze project! This program utilizes the Python turtle module to create an interactive maze game. Players navigate through a maze using keyboard inputs while a turtle character moves around the screen. The goal is to guide the turtle to reach the maze's exit, encountering obstacles and challenges along the way. This project is a fun and educational way to explore turtle graphics, problem-solving, and algorithmic thinking.

- Algorithm:
  Step 1: Import turtle and random modules.

  Step 2: Set up the screen, draw the maze, create the player, goal, and score turtles.

  Step 3: Create update_score() and show_error() functions.

  Step 4: Define movement functions and bind to arrow keys.

  Step 5: Enter main game loop and check for collisions.

  Step 6: Exit game loop.

- How to play the game:
  Here's a step-by-step guide on how to play the Turtle Maze game:
1. Launch the game: Open the Python code file in a Python environment or IDE, and run the code to launch the Turtle Maze game.
2. Explore the maze: Once the game starts, a turtle character will appear on the screen, representing the player. The turtle is initially placed at the maze entrance.
3. Move the turtle: Use the keyboard arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the turtle in different directions. The turtle can only move up, down, left, and right within the maze walls.
4. Reach the exit: Navigate the turtle through the maze and try to reach the exit, which can be marked by a specific symbol or location. Avoid colliding with obstacles or maze walls, as hitting them will reset the turtle to the starting position.
5. Complete the maze: Keep moving the turtle until you successfully guide it to the maze exit. Once the turtle reaches the exit, the game will indicate that you have completed the maze.
6. Repeat or exit: Depending on your game implementation, you may have the option to replay the maze or exit the game.
Note: Feel free to customize the game instructions or provide additional information if your Turtle Maze game contains extra features, such as collectibles or levels.
